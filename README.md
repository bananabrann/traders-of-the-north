Traders of the North is a simple web-hosted trading game. The player must pit their limited resources to strategically out-bid the opponent to take home the higher combination of items being offloaded from the longboat.

This build (v2.0) is currently undergoing a transition from JavaScript to TypeScript, as well as an infrastructure change from Amazon Web Services to Microsoft Azure. Once it's done, v2.0 will be officially released and a comprehensive readme added. I have a full-time job, so this project, especially the rewrite, might not go as fast as I would like. But stay tuned!

> To see the game in its previous v1.x state, visit the "legacy" branch. Instructions in that readme.

# Installation

### Mac
Very similar to Linux I imagine. If you have Brew and NPM installed, try running the Linux commands.

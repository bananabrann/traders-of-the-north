> This project has been undergoing a rewrite for quite some time. This project is primarily for myself and just having fun, so don't expect much.

> To see the game in its original state from 2018, [visit the `legacy` branch](https://github.com/bananabrann/traders-of-the-north/tree/legacy). Instructions in that readme. To see the game in its second original form prior to the transition to Unity, [go to the 'legacy2' branch](https://github.com/bananabrann/traders-of-the-north/tree/legacy2).

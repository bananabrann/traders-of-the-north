# Traders of the North 3D
This build is currently undergoing a transition from React and JavaScript to Unity and C#. The game will be hosted on the web, but for now not enough development has been made in order to justify work on a comprehensive README. Thanks for reading, stay tuned for **Traders of the North v3(D)**!

# The Structure of the Resource Folder
The majority of this folder is **namespaced** and retrieved as such from the `src/` directory during runtime, and thus should file names should be carefully renamed if renamed or moved at all. 

In the future, these resources may be moved to a remote server, like AWS EC2 or even S3 buckets, with the intent to protect the original source files from downloading in their full resolution.
